# Mystery Steam Theater
## NJIT - Fall 2019 - Group 8


Mystery Steam Theater is an application which checks your steam account, the steam account of your friends for video games which you have never played, or any others, and will find youtube videos and twitch streams related to those games, so you can decide if you should play them.
I don't know about you, but I certainly have a ton of games I bought on sale and then never launched.
