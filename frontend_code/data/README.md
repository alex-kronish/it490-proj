# Attention

All the json files stored in /data/ are meant to be used for 'mockup' data testing only, not to be used for the real project. The purpose of this is 
to learn how each collection of data is structured before parsing the json data and extract vital information for the client use. The json is meant to represent what the client is expected to receive from RabbitMQ v-hosts' queues to learn how to handle it on its own.
